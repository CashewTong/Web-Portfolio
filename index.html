                    Hello, my name is Matthew Tong. I am a 2nd year student at the University of British Columbia (UBC) studying to earn my Bachelor Degree in Electrical Engineering. I have a  strong passion in automation, controls, robotics and coding. Throughout my childhood, I grew up with many hobbies and passions but engineering and technology truly stuck with me. My adaptiveness, assertiveness and thrive to learn and application of my knowledge are strong characteristics I hope I have and will earn. My passion for technology and strive for improvement will help me grow as a person and be of influence to others. As technology advances, it is up to society to try and adapt to changes to produce the greatest outcome. To accommodate advancement, we need to learn about the growth of technology and start doing. I am a strong believer in working in teams and groups. Working in groups will allow strengths and weaknesses to be recognized and utilized for the benefit of the team. If given, I truly will take the opportunity to be the greatest asset others.

With the sonar sensor connected to a servo motor, the car is able to scan a full 180 degree for obstacles ahead to avoid collision. The infrared sensor allows the car to autonomously follow  a dark coloured line. As well, the Arduino Uno is connected to a Bluetooth module that allows connectivity to a remote via Bluetooth.

With restrictions to my UP Box+, I was unable to print my design in one piece, therefore I had to print it in two pieces.  It is a circle stand for a Google Wifi that allows wires to be hidden behind the device has it hangs from an outlet.  I wanted to build a 3D holder for the Google Wifi so it could look more elegant, easier to manage wires and save space.

It uses a sonar radar to read distances from a flat surface. Within the Arduino Uno board, it was programmed to read distances from the sonar every half a second and as it surpasses 0.5cm it will activate the servo motor to move 180 degrees. Once, the claw recognizes another 0.5cm distance gap from the sonar, it will turn 180 degrees in the opposite direction. The servo motor is connected to the claws with a stiff, copper wire to allow the claw to open and close to grab objects.

                        Using 8051 assembly and a AT89LP51RC2 microcontroller, I made an alarm clock that is able to display two different screens. The clock is able to display the time (like in image) and change from AM to PM and vice versa like a regular digital clock. Using an I/O port, a set of buttons are used to switch between clock and alarm mode. During alarm mode, the user is able to set a specific time for an alarm to sound from a small speaker module.

The main purpose of this program is to collect information from the user and output parameters for the most ideal solenoid. Certain inputs are shapes, wire gauge, wire material, and power source. Throughout the process, research was needed to be collected and documentation was created using Overleaf to digitally document our success and support our program. Ultimately, our goal is to make this program accessible for every team in the RoboCup community. As well, to further improve their robots and most importantly, help new teams in guiding them when building solenoids. This program is built with Python and Tkinter

                    <p>Given a scenario of building an affordable, foldable, lightweight chair that is able to be carried for long journeys. Our chair consisted of three major components, a base, seat and supports. The base was built in order to be easily built by allowing pieces to smoothly slide together. The seat is a long piece of cardboard that allows for a comfortable seat but the edge hangs over to give an aesthetic look while supporting the base from twisting. On the back, two support pieces were able to slide in to give the base more support to prevent twisting to occur. After experimenting, twisting is one of the main causes of structural failure in our prototypes. Our chair was able to sustain a consistent weight of 360 pounds while weighing less than 5 pounds.
